  It looks like crap in a text editor, but it has no effect on rendering, and it allows much more useful diffs.

# ``numerary`` release notes

## [0.0.5](https://github.com/posita/numerary/releases/tag/v0.0.5)

* Updates license to the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
* Gets rid of ``self`` redundancy in ``__isinstance__`` checks.

## [0.0.4](https://github.com/posita/numerary/releases/tag/v0.0.4)

* ``numerary`` *finally* leaves the [``dyce``](https://github.com/posita/dyce/) nest to become its own library!
  It didn’t *quite* leave before because its maintainer is a bonehead who doesn’t understand setuptools’ multitude of oh-so-simple packaging mechanisms.
  No, it stuck around most weekends to do laundry while eating all of ``dyce``’s food.
  *Now* it has *officially* left the nest.
