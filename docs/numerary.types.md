  It looks like crap in a text editor, but it has no effect on rendering, and it allows much more useful diffs.

# ``#!python numerary.types`` package reference

!!! warning "Experimental"

    This package is an attempt to ease compatibility between Python’s numbers and types.
    If that sounds like it shouldn’t be a thing, you won’t get any argument out of me.
    Anyhoo, this package should be considered experimental.
    I am working toward stability as quickly as possible, but be warned that future release may introduce incompatibilities or remove this package altogether.
    [Feedback, suggestions, and contributions](contrib.md) are desperately appreciated.
